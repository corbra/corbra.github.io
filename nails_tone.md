title: "Nails and Tone"
permalink: https://corbra.github.io/nails_tone/

Long nails are good for classical guitar but bad for almost everything else.  They don't look great and require a lot of maintenance; This can put many people off. For at least a year, I struggled with everything from nails catching the strings to thin sound. You need to be careful with zips and do everything with your left hand.
I spent a lot of time looking for a technique that would solve this and ultimately Scott Tennant’s Pumping Nylon made the difference.  There’s a great section in this book on nails and tone production.  Scott’s technique is based on keeping your nails relatively short.  It works perfectly for me and advanced my playing almost as soon as I tried it.
Not everyone likes the title but it’s a great book to have from beginners to advanced. It also has a really good repertoire of music thrown in, covering a wide range of styles. There are a few versions of this around, get the spiral bound compete version if you can.
